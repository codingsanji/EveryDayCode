3\. Modular Arithmetic

Modulus is the remainder obtained from a division operation. It is basically the number that is "wrapped around" after reaching a certain value and thus is often referred to as "clock arithmetic".

Operations:
	1) Modular Addition -> 

&nbsp;		 (a + b) mod m = ((a mod m) + (b mod m)) mod m

&nbsp;	2) Modular Subtraction ->

&nbsp;		 (a - b) mod m = ((a mod m) - (b mod m)+m) mod m 

&nbsp;	3) Modular Multiplication ->

&nbsp;		(a x b) mod m = ((a mod m) x (b mod m)) mod m

&nbsp;	4) Modular Division ->

&nbsp;		(a / b) mod m = (a x (inverse of b if exists)) mod m

&nbsp;	5) Modular Inverse
