DSA 1: Logic Building



Process of creating clear, step-by-step methods to solve problems using simple rules and principles. 



Mathematical Concepts:

1\. Number Theory

&nbsp;	a) Decimal      (Base 10 -> 0-9)

&nbsp;	b) Binary       (Base 2 -> 0,1)

&nbsp;	c) Octal        (Base 8 -> 0-7)

&nbsp;	d) Hexadecimal	(Base 16 -> 0-9, A-F)



Conversions:
1. Decimal	

&nbsp;	a) Binary = Repeated Division by 2. Read remainders from bottom up. 

&nbsp;	b) Octal = Repeated Division by 8. Read remainders from bottom up. 

&nbsp;	c) Hexadecimal = Repeated Division by 16. Read remainders from bottom up.

2\. Binary 

&nbsp;	a) Decimal = Positional Notation (sum of powers of 2).  

&nbsp;		eg: (1 \* 2^3) + (1 \* 2^2) + (0 \* 2^1) + (1 \* 2^0)

&nbsp;			= (1 \* 8) + (1 \* 4) + (0 \* 2) + (1 \* 1)

&nbsp;			= 8 + 4 + 0 + 1

&nbsp;			= 13

&nbsp;	b) Octal = Group binary digits in sets of three from right.

&nbsp;		eg: Group into 3s: 

&nbsp;			110 101

&nbsp;			110\_2 = 6\_8

&nbsp;			101\_2 = 5\_8 

&nbsp;			=65

&nbsp;	c) Hexadecimal = Group binary digits in sets of four from right. (similar to Octal conversion)

3\. Octal

&nbsp;	a) Decimal = Positional Notation (sum of powers of 8). (just like Binary to Decimal but 8 instead of 2)

&nbsp;	b) Binary = Convert each octal digit to its 3-bit binary equivalent. ( reverse of Binary to Octal )

&nbsp;	c) Hexadecimal = Convert Octal to Binary first, then Binary to Hexadecimal.

4\. Hexadecimal

&nbsp;	a) Decimal = Positional Notation (sum of powers of 16). (just like Binary to Decimal but 16 instead of 2)

&nbsp;	b) Binary = Convert each hex digit to its 4-bit binary equivalent.

&nbsp;		eg: 

&nbsp;			D\_16 = 1101\_2

&nbsp;			6\_16 = 0110\_2

&nbsp;	c) Octal = Convert Hexadecimal to Binary first, then Binary to Octal.
