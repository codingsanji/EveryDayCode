###### Introduction-



Project management is the use of knowledge, skills, tools and techniques to meet a project's requirements and achieve a desired outcome. Simply put, it is leading a team/group to complete a project within a specific time-frame. 

Skills to manage a project would be like,

&nbsp;	1. Planning and organizing 
&nbsp;	2. Managing tasks and timelines 
&nbsp;	3. Communicating to stakeholders 
&nbsp;	4. Budgeting



###### **A traditional management approach - Waterfall**

Uses a linear process. Each phase of the project flows into the next one (structured like a flow-chart). With this approach, one task/step is finished before the next one is started.



However, agile is **iterative**. In the sense, the team works on different tasks/steps simultaneously and project processes can be repeated many times throughout the project to incorporate feedback at every stage. In this case, the team operates within many small/short blocks of time called **iterations**. Iterations may be repeated depending on the received feedback. During each iteration, the team takes a subset of all the project’s activities and does all the work required to complete that subset of activities. 



Therefore agile can be more effective than traditional methods since,

&nbsp;	1. Resources are used simultaneously in smaller time frames called "**sprints**"
&nbsp;	2. Allows frequent stakeholder feedback and less time is spent on creating documentation or waiting for something to be completed
&nbsp;	3. Allows the project to be completed with lots of flexibility for growth and change

###### **Agile Manifesto :** 

Document that outlines the values and principles of the Agile approach. It is a collection of **four(4) values and twelve(12) principles** that define the mindset that all Agile teams should strive for.

The four(4) core values include:  (there is value in the items on the right but the items on the left are more valued)
&nbsp;	- **individuals and interactions** over processes and tools
&nbsp;	- **working software** over comprehensive documentation
&nbsp;	- **customer collaboration** over contract negotiation
&nbsp;	- **responding to change** over following a plan



The twelve(12) principles include:
&nbsp; 1. **Customer satisfaction** is the highest priority, achieved through early and continuous delivery of valuable software. (Whether you are working to create a product for your company or for a customer, chances are that someone is awaiting its delivery. If that delivery is delayed, the result is that the customer, user, or organization is left waiting for that added value to their lives and workflows. Agile emphasizes that delivering value to users early and often creates a steady value stream, increasing you and your customer’s success. This will build trust and confidence through continuous feedback as well as early business value realization.)
&nbsp; 2. **Welcome changing requirements**, even late in development. Agile processes harness change for the customer’s competitive advantage. (When working in Agile, it’s important to be agile. That means being able to move swiftly, shifting direction whenever necessary. That also means that you and your team are constantly scanning your environment to make sure necessary changes are factored into the plans. Acknowledging and embracing that your plans may change (once, twice, or several times) ensures that you and your customers are maximizing your success.)
&nbsp; 3. **Deliver working software frequently**, from a couple of weeks to a couple of months, with a preference for shorter timescales. (Delivering your product in small, frequent increments is important because it allows time and regular opportunities for stakeholders—including customers—to give feedback on its progress. This ensures that the team never spends too much time going down the wrong path.)
&nbsp; 4. **Business people and developers must work together daily** throughout the project. (Removing barriers between developers and people focused on the business side of the project, builds trust and understanding and ensures that the developers, or those building the solution, are in tune with the needs of the users. ) 
&nbsp; 5. **Build projects around motivated individuals.** Give them the environment and support they need, and trust them to get the job done. (A successful Agile team includes team members that not only trust each other to get the work done but are also trusted by their sponsors and executives to get the work done. Teams build better solutions when they are empowered and motivated to deliver difficult projects.) 
&nbsp; 6. **Face-to-face conversation** is the most efficient and effective method of conveying information within a development team.  (There isn’t anything quite like face-to-face communication. Face-to-face communication allows us to catch certain cues, body language, and facial expressions that are sometimes lost when using forms of communication like email, chat, or the phone. However, we can’t always be face-to-face. Establishing effective communication norms—no matter the format—is essential to effective teams. )
&nbsp; 7. **Working software is the primary measure of progress.** (In Agile teams, the main way to demonstrate meaningful completion of work is to show a working piece of the solution. In software teams, that might mean a functional piece of software. In non-software teams, that might mean a critical portion of the solution that is ready to be demonstrated to users or their representatives in order to collect feedback. This is in contrast to traditional or Waterfall projects, where the completion of project documents could be used to measure progress. In Agile project management, it is not enough to say that the team is 80% done with an activity if there is no working, demonstrable artifact available to review.) 
&nbsp; 8. **Agile processes promote sustainable development.** The sponsors, developers, and users should be able to maintain a constant pace indefinitely. (Maintaining a steady but careful pace will prevent errors along the way. Also, you never want your team to feel overworked or overwhelmed. On the flip side, a team that is underutilized may become bored and lose the creative spark to innovate. The Agile ideal is to achieve a steady pace of effort for the team that avoids overtime and burnout.) 
&nbsp; 9. **Continuous attention to technical excellence and good design** enhances agility. (his principle conveys that just because the team is working fast doesn’t mean they sacrifice quality. By emphasizing quality and design throughout the project development phase, the agility, efficiency, and speed of the team will be increased. When a team delivers a well-built solution, they can quickly respond to user feedback and new information. However, if the product is low quality, implementing changes can become problematic, complex, and slow down the entire team. ) 
&nbsp; 10. **Simplicity**—the art of maximizing the amount of work not done—is essential.  (The team should avoid implementing extra features into the solution that weren’t explicitly requested by the user or product owner. This includes removing procedures that are no longer necessary, and reducing unnecessary documentation. )
&nbsp; 11. **The best architectures, requirements, and designs emerge from self-organizing teams.**  ( Team members should be able to get their work done by designing their own work processes and practices, without a manager dictating how they operate. Team members should also feel empowered to speak up with questions, concerns, or feedback.)
&nbsp; 12. **At regular intervals, the team reflects on how to become more effective,** then tunes and adjusts its behavior accordingly. (In Agile, it is important to acknowledge that learning from successes and failures is continuous. No team is perfect. There will be mistakes, challenges, trials, and triumphs. Teams should reflect on all of these different aspects of their activities so that they can make necessary adjustments. )	


###### **Question 1**
In this scenario, you're a project manager reflecting on what processes went well and what could be improved for your team’s next project. Currently, your team uses the Waterfall approach. During the last project, you realized your team was generating more documentation than the client needed. The client also wanted some changes to the final product after delivery, which your previous approach didn’t take into account. Because of this, you’re considering adopting a new approach for your team.   

Reflect on the scenario, then answer the following questions:
- How could an Agile approach address some of the project concerns in this scenario?
- How is the Agile approach different from Waterfall?
- When it comes to deliverables, what are the differences between Waterfall and Agile?
- What are the benefits of an Agile approach?

Your response should be approximately 3-4 sentences.

***Answer:*** An agile approach could easily address this problem by allowing for greater flexibility and adaptability to change. Unlike the Waterfall approach, which moves sequentially through distinct phases like requirements, design, implementation and documentation without a feedback loop, the Agile method prioritizes delivering a working product in smaller, iterative cycles (called sprints) with continuous client feedback thus creating/generating less documentation and allows for continuous improvement and adaptation as it is in the works. The main benefit of Agile is that it minimizes the risk of delivering a product that doesn't meet the client's needs since the client is a key part of the development process. 




###### **Adopting an Agile mindset for projects** 
Agile is about delivering value in a world with high degrees of uncertainty, risk, and competition. It sets a team up to react as quickly as possible to new information, new market opportunities, and even new technologies and thus works best in industries or projects that are susceptible to or that encourage change and uncertainty. Example of such industries : BioTech, Media, Food, Fashion (but not limited to these industries).

**VUCA** : An acronym that defines the conditions that affect the organizations in a changing and complex world. It stands for **V**olatility (rapid and unpredictable change), **U**ncertainty (lack of clarity about future outcomes), **C**omplexity (many interconnected factors and variables), **A**mbiguity (unclear meaning or interpretation).
