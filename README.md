# EveryDayCode

Welcome to **CodeEveryDay** — a personal challenge and journey to improve coding skills by writing **one program every single day**!  

## 🎯 Goal

The main goal of this repository is simple:

> ✅ **Write and commit one program per day (Daily Commit).** The goal is to **code consistently, learn continuously, and build discipline**.

---

## 🗂️ Structure

This repo is organized by **language and topic (with date)**. For example:

- (Python) `20250928_HelloWorld.py`
- (Java)   `20300629_LinkedListExample.java`

Each question or program is implemented in **multiple languages**, so the practice feels more balanced and helps build a stronger foundation across different stacks.
